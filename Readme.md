### Blockchain Playground ###

This is a simple learning playground app written in TypeScript that implements a very basic blockchain idea. 

I've included the *dist* folder so you can run the app straight away. 

To run, simply clone the repo and run the main.js file under the dist folder. You can choose to display the JSON string of the blockchain in the console prompt.
